## 2026-03-14 - Batching DOM updates in Vanilla JS
**Learning:** In a vanilla JS architecture, appending hundreds of elements directly to the active DOM in a loop (like lists of rows) causes expensive O(N) layout thrashing and reflows. Since this project explicitly avoids frameworks like React/Vue, this performance bottleneck is particularly critical.
**Action:** Always use `DocumentFragment` to batch DOM appends when rendering lists or generating multiple elements. Append the fragment once to the active DOM to ensure a single reflow instead of N reflows.

## 2026-03-15 - Event Delegation in Vanilla JS
**Learning:** Attaching event listeners inside a loop (like `items.forEach`) for a list of hundreds of elements consumes significant memory and slows down the render loop (`O(N)` listener attachments).
**Action:** Always use event delegation for large lists. Attach a single event listener to the parent container (`listEl`) and use `e.target.closest('.row')` to determine the target element, turning `O(N)` memory into `O(1)`.

## 2026-03-15 - RegExp Precompilation
**Learning:** Re-instantiating the same regular expression literal inside a `.forEach` render loop adds a measurable overhead to execution time because the regex engine compiles it repeatedly.
**Action:** When working with vanilla JS, extract constant regex patterns and assign them to a variable outside the render loop or function to avoid redundant compilations.

## 2026-04-26 - Avoiding O(N log N) Global Sorting for Aggregations
**Learning:** In this vanilla JS architecture, using global helper functions like `sortedPlaces()` (which performs O(N log N) sorting and O(N) Haversine distance calculations) to fetch base data when only basic aggregation or counting by category is needed causes severe performance drops. Calling it inside an N-iteration loop compounds the issue even further.
**Action:** Always perform a single O(N) iteration over the base data array (`PLACES`) using a hash map to aggregate counts and filter data, completely avoiding expensive geographic sorting functions unless sorting is specifically required for the view.
